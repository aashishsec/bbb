## Overview

- The "httpAlive" tool is designed to efficiently probe for alive subdomains and URLs from a provided list.
- It includes features such as user-agent rotation, colorized output, multithreading, and a command-line interface (CLI) for ease of use.
- Works in all platforms.

## Features

1. **User-Agent Rotation:**
   - Randomly selects a user agent from a predefined list for each HTTP request to avoid detection.

2. **Colorized Output:**
   - Utilizes the `colorama` library to provide colorized and visually appealing output.

3. **Multithreading:**
   - Implements multithreading using Python's `concurrent.futures` module for concurrent execution of HTTP requests.

4. **HTTP Client:**
   - Utilizes the `httpx` library as the HTTP client with SSL certificate verification disabled.

5. **Command-Line Interface (CLI):**
   - Accepts command-line arguments through the `argparse` module for easy configuration.

6. **Output File:**
   - Saves results to an output file specified by the user (default: "httpAlive_output.txt").

7. **Banner Display:**
   - Displays a colorful banner at the beginning with information about the tool, author, and GitHub profile.

8. **Exception Handling:**
   - Includes exception handling to gracefully handle interruptions, such as `KeyboardInterrupt`.

        httpAlive is a tool designed to efficiently probe for alive subdomains and Urls from a provided list.


usage: httpalive-Mark9.py [-h] -l list [-o output] [-c CONCURRENCY] [-t THREADS]

options:

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit.

  -l list, --DomainList list
                        [INFO]: List of Subdomains or URLs.

  -o output, --output output
                        [INFO]: File to save our output.

  -c CONCURRENCY, --concurrency CONCURRENCY
                        [INFO]: Concurrency level to make fast process.

  -t THREADS, --threads THREADS
                        [INFO]: Threading level to make fast process.

```

## Usage

- Create a file containing that contains list of URLs or subdoamins or both and give to httpAlive. The output contains status codes and content length.

- This python code will save the results of the analysis to a file named 'output.txt'.

- Run the script with urls or subdomain list.

### Note
- Do not give more threads. It might cause Race Condition

### Method 1

```bash

python ./httpAlive/httpAlive -l subdomainList.txt

```
